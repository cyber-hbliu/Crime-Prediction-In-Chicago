## Reference

> LinearRegression fits a linear model with coefficients w = (w1, â€¦, wp) to minimize the residual sum of squares between the observed targets in the dataset, and the targets predicted by the linear approximation.

--- 
> A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of classifying decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is controlled with the max_samples parameter if bootstrap=True (default), otherwise the whole dataset is used to build each tree.

---
> The KMeans algorithm clusters data by trying to separate samples in n groups of equal variance, minimizing a criterion known as the inertia or within-cluster sum-of-squares (see below). This algorithm requires the number of clusters to be specified. It scales well to large numbers of samples and has been used across a large range of application areas in many different fields.
